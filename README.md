# Soundboard-Using-PySide6
This is a soundboard created through the PySide6 library. The aim is to provide a free soundboard alternative to Discord's paywalled and limited feature set.

However, this application can be used anywhere that a user wishes to play audio through their microphones, allowing a universal soundboard for any application, all in one place.

To download the application, see the tab on the right called [Releases](https://github.com/BattmannWann/Soundboard-Using-PySide6/releases), and download the installer from there
